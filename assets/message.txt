    Hmm... your pockets seem a little light.
    Not enough coins, I’m afraid. Come back when you’re richer!
    You’ll need a bit more to afford that, my friend.
    A fine choice, but it seems you’re short on funds.
    I’d love to sell it to you, but you’re a few coins short.
    No money, no deal. It’s as simple as that.
    You’ll have to earn a bit more before you can buy that.
    I don’t give credit, so come back when you’ve got the cash.
    That’s a bit out of your price range... for now.
    Save up a little more, and it’s yours!

    Did you know this shop is older than time itself? No? Well, now you do.
    I once sold a key to a man who escaped the impossible. He never came back.
    Some say my shop appears only to those who truly need it.
    Careful with that item—it’s got a bit of a temper.
    I don’t ask questions, and neither should you.
    Every item here has a story. Most of them are true.
    You look like someone who’s seen a few puzzles in their time.
    I’ve got things here you didn’t even know you needed.
    The last person who bought that item... well, let’s just say they’re doing fine. Probably.
    I don’t sell maps to secret exits. Nice try, though.
    You’re not the first to try haggling with me. You won’t succeed.
    That item? Oh, it’s cursed. But don’t let that stop you!
    I’d give you advice, but that’s extra.
    You break it, you buy it. No exceptions.
    I’ve been expecting you. Strange, isn’t it?
    Some say my shop is magical. I say it’s just good business.
    I don’t sell to just anyone, you know. Consider yourself lucky.
    You’ve got the look of someone who’s been through a lot.
    This shop has been in my family for generations. Don’t break anything.
    I sense you’re close to something big. Care to share?

    The items here choose their owners. Choose wisely.
    You’re not just buying an item—you’re buying a piece of the puzzle.

    Some secrets can’t be bought... but these can.
    The right choice now could save you later.
    The future is written in the items you choose.
    Every purchase is a step closer to your goal.
    The right tool at the right time can change everything.
    Some say my shop exists outside of time. Who am I to argue?
    The items you buy today may shape your destiny.
    I’ve got things here that even I don’t fully understand.
    You’re not the first adventurer to visit, and you won’t be the last.
    I’ve seen people like you before. They either succeed... or disappear.
    The right item can make the difference between life and death. Choose wisely.
    I don’t ask where you’re escaping from. It’s better that way.
    Some items here are more dangerous than they look. Proceed with caution.
    You’re not just buying an item—you’re buying a chance.
    The shop knows what you need. Do you?
    I’ve got things here that even the bravest adventurers fear.
    Every item has a price. Some are just higher than others.
