Sorry, you'll need more coins for that.
Come back when you've got more coins!
That's a bit out of your price range.
Better start saving up!
I can't give discounts, sorry!
Maybe try something cheaper?
I don't accept credit!
No haggling allowed!
Hmm... your pockets seem a little light.
Not enough coins, I’m afraid. Come back when you’re richer!
You’ll need a bit more to afford that, my friend.
A fine choice, but it seems you’re short on funds.
I’d love to sell it to you, but you’re a few coins short.
No money, no deal. It’s as simple as that.
You’ll have to earn a bit more before you can buy that.
I don’t give credit, so come back when you’ve got the cash.
That’s a bit out of your price range... for now.
Save up a little more, and it’s yours!
